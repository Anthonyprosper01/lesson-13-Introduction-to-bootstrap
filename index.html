        <p class="bg-success">Gaming refers to the activity of playing video games, which can range from simple mobile games to complex, immersive
        experiences on consoles or PCs. It encompasses various genres like action, adventure, role-playing, strategy, and
        sports, often involving single-player or multiplayer modes. Video games have evolved into a global entertainment
        industry, blending technology, storytelling, and creativity. Gaming also promotes social interaction, with online
        communities, esports competitions, and streaming platforms growing in prominence.</p>
        <p class="bg-secondary">Gamers are individuals who engage in playing video games as a hobby, passion, or competitive activity. They can be
        casual players, enjoying games in their free time, or more dedicated enthusiasts who spend significant time mastering
        complex titles. Gamers often form communities both online and offline, sharing tips, competing in tournaments, and
        collaborating in multiplayer experiences. The gaming culture is diverse, with players spanning all ages, backgrounds,
        and skill levels. Many gamers identify with specific gaming platforms (e.g., PC, console, mobile) or genres, and some
        even make careers in esports, streaming, or game development.</p>
